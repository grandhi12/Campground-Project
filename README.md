YelpCamp is a comprehensive full-stack web application that enables users to create and review campgrounds. To submit a review or add a new campground, users must first register an account. This project is a component of Colt Steele's web development bootcamp on Udemy.

The application is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, with Passport.js managing user authentication.
